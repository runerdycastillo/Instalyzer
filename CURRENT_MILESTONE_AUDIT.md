# Current Milestone Audit

Use this document for the current build phase, not full launch readiness.

Current milestone focus:

- Finish the Next.js migration for the soft-launch core user flow
- Replace placeholder routes with real product surfaces
- Preserve the static product quality while simplifying toward a free launch
- Keep momentum without losing track of polish, bugs, and gaps

## How To Use

- Update this at the end of a work session in 3-5 minutes
- Only record the highest-signal changes, risks, and next checks
- Keep launch-level concerns in `PRE_LAUNCH_SAAS_AUDIT.md`
- Treat this as the practical checkpoint doc for active development

## Current Milestone Scope

- [x] Dataset creation flow implemented
- [x] Datasets index implemented
- [x] Dataset workspace implemented
- [ ] Native `Not Following Back` route implemented

Notes:

- Stable areas:
- Confidence level:

### 3. What Still Feels Incomplete

- [ ] Placeholder content still remains
- [ ] UX still needs polish
- [ ] Error handling is still thin
- [ ] Mobile behavior still needs review
- [ ] Copy still needs cleanup

Notes:

- Main gaps:
- Anything intentionally deferred:

### 4. Quick Risk Check

- [ ] No major blocker discovered
- [ ] No hidden dependency surfaced
- [ ] No serious product-direction mismatch discovered
- [ ] No major trust/privacy concern introduced

Notes:

- Biggest current risk:
- What could slow the next session down:

### 5. Quick Manual Checks

- [ ] Tested the changed route manually
- [ ] Tested related buttons/links
- [ ] Tested refresh behavior if relevant
- [ ] Tested theme behavior if relevant
- [ ] Tested mobile layout if relevant

Notes:

- What was tested:
- What was not tested:

### 6. Next Best Move

- [ ] Next task is clearly defined
- [ ] Needed docs/context are captured
- [ ] No important handoff detail is missing

Notes:

- Next recommended task:
- Prerequisites for next session:

## Milestone-Specific Checks

Use this section to track the current migration flow specifically.

### Marketing Flow

- [x] Hero feels polished
- [x] Tools section migrated
- [x] How it works section migrated
- [x] Results preview migrated
- [x] Pricing section migrated
- [x] FAQ section migrated
- [x] Final CTA migrated
- [x] `/help` route is real, not placeholder

### App Flow

- [x] CTA leads into a real dataset creation experience
- [x] Upload flow accepts the right Instagram export
- [x] Upload step is clear
- [x] Dataset creation step is clear
- [x] Upload-to-create processing handoff feels intentional
- [x] Dataset workspace is real
- [ ] Tool 1 works natively in Next

### Technical Foundation

- [x] Theme behavior is stable
- [x] Landing-page refresh behavior is stable
- [x] Basic route/layout structure is in place
- [ ] Parser logic is extracted into reusable modules
- [x] Storage/data boundaries are intentionally designed
- [x] Placeholder routes are being retired in order

---

## Rolling Fix List

### Fix Next

- [ ] Finish the dataset overview so the post-create workspace feels launch-ready
- Why now: the upload/create handoff is in a much stronger place, so the next gain is making the first dataset landing experience feel equally intentional

### Watch Soon

- [ ] Implement the native `Not Following Back` tool in Next
- Why soon: the soft-launch story now depends on one real live tool more than on a broader platform narrative

- [ ] Port deeper parser logic from the static flow into reusable modules
- Why soon: the current route supports the launch flow, but real archive inspection is still lighter than the static prototype

### Leave For Later

- [ ] Revisit whether `/app` remains a true hub or redirects into datasets
- Why later: the dataset creation and workspace routes matter more than polishing the app-home shell right now

### Session Entry - 2026-03-25

- Date: 2026-03-25
- Focus: finish the marketing/help migration and improve planning clarity for the next phase
- What moved forward:
  - homepage sales flow was completed with pricing, faq, and final cta
  - `/help` was replaced with the real export guide and polished toward the static reference
  - launch and milestone audit docs were created/refined
  - new docs were added for actual export data and realistic tool opportunities
- What remains rough:
  - app-side routes are still mostly placeholder territory after the marketing handoff
  - parser/domain extraction work still remains ahead
- Biggest risk:
  - the product story is much clearer than the actual dataset/workspace/tool implementation, so the next session needs to close that gap
- Next step:
  - build dataset creation, dataset overview, and native Tool 1 in `instalyzer-next`

### Session Entry - 2026-03-26

- Date: 2026-03-26
- Focus: build the first real dataset creation route in Next and shape it into a more polished SaaS-style upload experience
- What moved forward:
  - `/app/datasets/new` was replaced with a real route-native 3-step flow for upload, review, and setup
  - main homepage/help/workspace CTAs now lead into the real dataset flow instead of a placeholder
  - lightweight local dataset storage, a real datasets index, and a basic dataset workspace handoff were added
  - the upload step went through several design passes to improve focus, trust, and consistency with the rest of the product
- What remains rough:
  - the dataset creation route still needs more polish in hierarchy, spacing, copy, and overall premium feel
  - review/setup steps still need another pass so they match the quality of the upload step
  - parser extraction is still ahead, so archive inspection remains lighter than the static version
- Biggest risk:
  - the route is real now, but if we stop here the upload step could still feel more like a strong draft than a fully locked product experience
- Next step:
  - continue polishing the dataset creation page, especially the upload panel, review state, and setup state, before moving deeper into Tool 1 porting

### Session Entry - 2026-03-30

- Date: 2026-03-30
- Focus: pivot the Next app toward a soft-launch free product and polish the dataset creation flow around that direction
- What moved forward:
  - homepage messaging was reframed around a free launch with `Not Following Back` as the live tool and more tools marked as coming soon
  - pricing was hidden behind a temporary conditional instead of being removed
  - the app was simplified to dark-only for the soft launch
  - iconography across the marketing/app flow was cleaned up with `lucide-react`
  - `/app/datasets/new` was heavily refined from a 3-step upload/review/setup flow into a cleaner `upload -> create` experience
  - the create step was centered, simplified, and given a subtle processing handoff between upload and dataset creation
  - the upload/create flow now feels much closer to a polished launch surface than an internal migration screen
- What remains rough:
  - the dataset overview/workspace still needs another pass so it matches the quality of the new dataset flow
  - the native `Not Following Back` route is still the biggest missing launch piece
  - deeper parser extraction still remains ahead
- Biggest risk:
  - the soft-launch story is now much clearer than the actual live-tool depth, so the next session needs to complete the overview and Tool 1 path without losing this polish
- Next step:
  - finish the dataset overview/workspace and then implement the native `Not Following Back` tool for the soft launch
